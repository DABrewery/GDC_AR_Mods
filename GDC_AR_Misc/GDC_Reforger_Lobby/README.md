# GDC Reforger Lobby

## Purpose
This mod adds Seskel's Reforger Lobby and tune a few game mode parameters (e.g. delay between briefing and game state). Reforger Lobby is a fantastic mod that provides two very important features :
- a real lobby alla Arma 2 with many cool features
- a game mode with no respawn. When a player is dead, it is definitive. Instead of respawning, the player is taken on spectator view.
For any information about Sekel's Reforger Lobby, see Reforger Lobby on AR Workshop

This mod also adds RHS factions :
- Custom loadouts :
  - 4 bandages and 2 morphine injectors for everyone
  - su230 (Eotech Holosight) in place of regular RCO (AN/PVQ-31) for riflemen and derived loadouts
  - 10 magazines for rifles, 2 grenades and 2 white smokes for nearly every loadouts
  - medical kit for medics
  - su230/PVS optic (1-4x) for leaders
- Playable groups : all group names finishing with _P are playable groups
